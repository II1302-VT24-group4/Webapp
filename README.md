# Webapp

download

https://nodejs.org/en/download/current

and

https://git-scm.com/downloads

optionally, download git desktop if you prefer using that over using the terminal

clone the Webapp project

cd to the project installation in your terminal, so for example for me it's C:\Users\Andreas\Documents\GitHub\Webapp

in the console, run the following commands

npm install

npm install fullcalendar

npm install reactjs-popup

npm install react-beautiful-dnd --save

npm install react-datepicker

now to run the program, run the following command in the console

npm run dev

if it runs correctily you will now be hosting the website locally, so try entering localhost:8080 in your browser to see the website.
